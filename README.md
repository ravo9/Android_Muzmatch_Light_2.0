# Android_Muzmatch_Light_2.0


What has been done in the current version:

1. General app structure based on the clean MVVM design pattern, using ViewModel, repositories, data persistence (based on the Room library). The whole code is written using Kotlin language.

2. A good progress in the UI, including custom EditText View, and message bubbles.

3. First stage of animations implementation (messages are animated, and moved along the RecyclerView).


What I will continue to work on:

1. Code cleaning.

2. Fixing issues related to bubbles and their correct form that may be changed by the time.

3. Send button fucntionality (is created, but not connected).

4. Unit and UI Testing (using JUnit and Espresso frameworks).

5. Second stage of animations implementation (message transition between EditText and RecyclerView).

6. Timestamps displaying.
